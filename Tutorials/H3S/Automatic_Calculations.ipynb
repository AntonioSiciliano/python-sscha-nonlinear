    "Thanks to the very light mass of hydrogen atoms, its physical properties are dominated by anharmonicity and quantum fluctuations, making it the on of the best systems to be tackled with self-consistent harmonic approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this simple tutorial we will learn how to run an automatic quantum relaxation. \n",
    "We will follow the lines of these works: [Errea et al. Nature volume 532, pages81â€“84(2016)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature17175) and [Bianco et al Phys. Rev. B 97, 214101](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.97.214101).\n",

    "The harmonic dynamical matrix are given as computed by quantum espresso, however, they can be recomputed live by running the get_phonons.py script (needs ASE and quantum-espresso phonon package).\n",

    "We will complete the PbTe simulation to get some usefull results.\n",
