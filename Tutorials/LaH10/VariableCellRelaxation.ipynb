    "Usually for high pressure materials, the bulk modulus is around hundreds of GPa, while for ice at ambient pressure is about 10 GPa. A high value of the bulk modulus will mean a slower change in the unit cell, so if you have the fealing that the unit cell is not changing a lot between sequent steps, try to reduce it.  "
